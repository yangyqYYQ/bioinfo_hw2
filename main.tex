\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Quality Control}

To check if there exists any microarry chips that perform abnormally, I first briefly visualized the distribution of expression level for each chip in Relative Log Expression Level(REL) with the package \textit{Oligo}. \cite{csdn.net} It is revealed that the total expression level among these chips are approximately the same.  Consequently, I can make sure that all microarry data are reliable and can be applied to subsequent analysis.

\subsubsection*{Differential Expression Gene Analysis}

Rawdata retrieved from chips are read in with the package \textit{Affy}, and are pretreated using \textit{rma} algorithm, which are proved to have a better performance in enhancing the signal from Perfect Match(PM) probes \cite{jianshu.com}. 

By respectively comparing the data retrieved from transcription-activator-A-knocked out(abbreviated as sample A below) and transcription-activator-B-knocked out(abbreviated as sample B below) samples with data from control samples, a Differential Expression Gene Analysis has been performed. Result shows that more genes are differentially expressed in samples treated with siRNA B, The threshold of differntial expression is determined by $abs(logFC) > 1.5$ and $adj.P.value < 0.05$ so as to remove as much false positive results as possible.  The result are drawn as volcanoplots listed below.
After figuring out the number of significantly expressed genes respectively in sample A and B, I found that sample B contains dramitically higher number of differential expressed genes.
