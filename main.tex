\noindent Please note: Abbreviations should be introduced at the first mention in the main text â€“ no abbreviations lists. Suggested structure of main text (not enforced) is provided below.

\section*{Introduction}

The Introduction section, of referenced text\cite{csdn.net} expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable). The introduction should not include subheadings.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Quantification of Microarray}

To check if there exists any microarry chips that perform abnormally, I first briefly visualized the distribution of expression level for each chip in $log_2$-scale, boxplot and hist(density estimate).  It is revealed that the total expression level among these chips are approximately the same.

\bibliography{sample}

\noindent LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command for an inline citation, e.g.  \cite{Hao:gidmaps:2014}.

For data citations of datasets uploaded to e.g. \emph{figshare}, please use the \verb|howpublished| option in the bib entry to specify the platform and the link, as in the \verb|Hao:gidmaps:2014| example in the sample bibliography file.

\section*{Acknowledgements (not compulsory)}

Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks to anonymous referees and editors, or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged.

\section*{Author contributions statement}

Must include all authors, identified by initials, for example:
A.A. conceived the experiment(s),  A.A. and B.A. conducted the experiment(s), C.A. and D.A. analysed the results.  All authors reviewed the manuscript. 

\section*{Additional information}

To include, in this order: \textbf{Accession codes} (where applicable); \textbf{Competing interests} (mandatory statement). 

The corresponding author is responsible for submitting a \href{http://www.nature.com/srep/policies/index.html#competing}{competing interests statement} on behalf of all authors of the paper. This statement must be included in the submitted article file.
